# Make Music. Make Code.

Make Music Make Code - with the micro:bit is a 2016 Hackathon project

https://garagehackbox.azurewebsites.net/hackathons/761/projects/45031 

Our focus on using the micro:bit IDE at https://codethemicrobit.com with Blockly or/or Typescript/JavaScript 

The goal is to Build fun and engaging projects for students - Definitely build an electronic music synthesizer, hopefully multiple music related projects

We will create basic instructions on building hardware and creating and modifying the code

As time permits, we will create curriculum, such as:
- Music: Scale, tone, beat...
- Science: waves, frequency, interference, circuits...
- Code: Types, Variables, math operators, Loops, Logic, Functions, Map, Array.
